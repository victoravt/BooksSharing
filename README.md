### Subtask 1: Implement the foundational structure of the application
Time spent on this subtask: [1h + 30min of env setup]
Comments: The Copilot generated secrets for dev, test, prod envs connection strings based on my written configuration string for dev env. 

### Subtask 2: Implement the basic data models and database schema
Time spent on this subtask: [3h (day2) ....]
Comments: Genere and Tag entity fields was suggested by Copilot. 
            Amazingly copilot genereated GenericRepository methods. But didn't went to deep of application to find that Db access context class is AppDbContext not BooksSharingContext as it generated. But still it's doing good :)
            Also the Copilot recognize interface that class should implement and suggests apropriate methods.
            It also genereated almost all DbSets in AppDbContext

The copilot don't take into account that it suggests class property which obviously is datetime (ex DueDate, or somthingDate)
